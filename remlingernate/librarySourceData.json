        "description": "This study aims to analyze the effect of the body mass index (BMI) on E2, P and LH values in females who received intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment on human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) day. A total of 2319\u2009cycles of IUI-assisted pregnancy treatment were selected in our hospital. Based on the BMI, female infertility patients are divided into three groups: normal weight group, overweight and obese group. For patients with natural cycles and\u2009\u2264\u200935\u2009years old, there were 440, 178 and 197 cases in the three groups, respectively. For patients with natural cycles and\u2009&gt;\u200935\u2009years old, there were 90, 83 and 81\u2009cycles in the three groups, respectively. For patients with induced ovulation cycle and\u2009\u2264\u200935\u2009years old, there were 425, 203 and 516 cases in the three groups, respectively. For patients with induced ovulation cycle and\u2009&gt;\u200935\u2009years old, there were 26, 26 and 54 cases in the three groups, respectively. When a patient is \u226435\u2009years old, the BMI affects the E2, LH and P values on the day of artificial insemination. However, the BMI is negatively correlated with E2, LH and P in IUI on HCG day. After controlling for age and assisted pregnancy, the correlation analysis revealed that the BMI is negatively correlated with hormone E2 and LH. The higher the BMI was, the lower the levels of hormones E2, LH and P became. However, in the present study, the BMI did not significantly improve the clinical pregnancy rate of patients who received IUI.",

        "description": "The recent pandemic caused by the 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) has affected more than 3.0 million people resulting ~\u2009212,000 deaths across 215 countries/territories as on 28th April 2020. The importation of the cases owing to enormous international travels from the affected countries is the foremost reason for local cycle of transmission. For a country like India, the second most populous country in the world with ~\u20091.35 billion population, the management and control of 2019-nCoV domestic spread heavily relied on effective screening and strict quarantine of passengers arriving at various international airports in India from affected countries. Here, by extracting the data from FLIRT, an online airline database for more than 800 airlines, and scanning more than 180,000 flights and 39.9 million corresponding passenger seats during 4th \u2013 25th March, we show that India experienced the highest risk index of importing the passengers from middle eastern airports. Contrary to perception, travelers from China imposed lowest risk of importing the infected cases in India. This is clearly evident form the fact that while the number of infected cases were on the peak in China India was one of the least affected countries. The number of cases in India started exhibiting a sharp increase in the infected cases only after the European countries and USA recorded large number of infected cases. We further argue that while the number of cases in middle eastern countries may still be very low, the airports in middle eastern countries, particularly Dubai, being one of the largest transit hubs for international passengers, including arriving in India, might have posed a higher risk of getting infected with 2019-nCoV. We suggest that any future travel related disease infection screening at the airports should critically assess the passengers from major transit hubs in addition to affected country of origin.",

        "description": "Dissecting the molecular landscape of fibrotic disease, a major unmet need, will inform the development of novel treatment strategies to target disease progression and identify desperately needed therapeutic targets. Here, we provide a detailed single-cell analysis of the immune landscape in Dupuytren's disease, a localized fibrotic condition of the hand, and identify a pathogenic signaling circuit between stromal and immune cells. We demonstrate M2 macrophages and mast cells as key cellular sources of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that promotes myofibroblast development. TNF acts via the inducible TNFR2 receptor and stimulates interleukin-33 (IL-33) secretion by myofibroblasts. In turn, stromal cell IL-33 acts as a potent stimulus for TNF production from immune cells. Targeting this reciprocal signaling pathway represents a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit the low-grade inflammation in fibrosis and the mechanism that drives chronicity.",

        "description": "Human and murine skin wounding commonly results in fibrotic scarring, but the murine wounding model wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) can frequently result in a regenerative repair response. Here, we show in single-cell RNA sequencing comparisons of semi-regenerative and fibrotic WIHN wounds, increased expression of phagocytic/lysosomal genes in macrophages associated with predominance of fibrotic myofibroblasts in fibrotic wounds. Investigation revealed that macrophages in the late wound drive fibrosis by phagocytizing dermal Wnt inhibitor SFRP4 to establish persistent Wnt activity. In accordance, phagocytosis abrogation resulted in transient Wnt activity and a more regenerative healing. Phagocytosis of SFRP4 was integrin-mediated and dependent on the interaction of SFRP4 with the EDA splice variant of fibronectin. In the human skin condition hidradenitis suppurativa, phagocytosis of SFRP4 by macrophages correlated with fibrotic wound repair. These results reveal that macrophages can modulate a key signaling pathway via phagocytosis to alter the skin wound healing fate.",

Here, we describe the design and synthesis of plant virus nanoparticles displaying peptides associated with two different autoimmune diseases. Using animal models, we show that the recombinant nanoparticles can prevent autoimmune diabetes and ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis. In both cases, this effect is based on a strictly peptide-related mechanism in which the virus nanoparticle acts both as a peptide scaffold and as an adjuvant, showing an overlapping mechanism of action. This successful preclinical testing could pave the way for the development of plant viruses for the clinical treatment of human autoimmune diseases.",

        "description": "Transcriptional bursting is the stochastic activation and inactivation of promoters, contributing to cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of transcriptional bursting kinetics (burst size and frequency) in mammalian cells remains elusive. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the intrinsic noise and mRNA levels for elucidating the transcriptional bursting kinetics in mouse embryonic stem cells. Informatics analyses and functional assays revealed that transcriptional bursting kinetics was regulated by a combination of promoter- and gene body\u2013binding proteins, including the polycomb repressive complex 2 and transcription elongation factors. Furthermore, large-scale CRISPR-Cas9\u2013based screening identified that the Akt/MAPK signaling pathway regulated bursting kinetics by modulating transcription elongation efficiency. These results uncovered the key molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting and cell-to-cell gene expression noise in mammalian cells.",
